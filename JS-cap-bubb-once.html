<!-- IN THIS DOCUMENT, WE'LL LEARN ABOUT EVENT CAPTURE, BUBBLING STOP PROPAGATION AND ONCE.

* Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, 
  when an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. 
  The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event.

* With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.

* With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.

* Capturing is also called "trickling", which helps remember the propagation order:

  --trickle down, bubble up.

* We can use the addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture) to register event handlers for in either bubbling (default) or capturing mode. 
  To use the capturing model pass the third argument as true.-->
